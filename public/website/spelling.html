      What is a Spelling Bee?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      This term we will be holding a spelling bee at schools. A spelling bee is a competition in which contestants are asked to spell a broad selection of words, usually with a varying degree of difficulty.
      
      
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Children are asked to stand up in front of an audience and spell a word that is given to them. They will be given the word and will hear the word used in a sentence. If they spell the word correctly they move forward into the next round. The round continue until a final winner is found
    </h3>

      What is the schools Spelling Bee?
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Each class will hold a spelling bee to find their 'top spellers' and the winners from each will then compete together in a KS1 grand final at school on Friday 22nd March 2019.
                                                                                                                               
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The KS1 final will be an informal event and an opportunity for children to have the experience of spelling in front of a friendly audience. The parents of the competing children will be invited to attend.
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What words will the children have to spell?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The national Curriculum for English sets out what children should learn in each year group. In Reception, Year1 and Year 2 the National Curriculum focuses on learning sounds and common spelling patterns. Over the three years, children will learn a variety of spelling patterns building on the patterns they have learned previously.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      The children have been completing spelling work in schools. Teachers will also send spellings home for the children to practise. In the Spelling Bee, children will be asked to spell words using spelling patterns that they have learned in their class. There may also be some 'tricky' words, which use the spelling patterns, but that the children have not heard or learned before. 
    </h3>
    <h2>
      What can I do as a parent/carer?
    </h2>
    <h3>
      Please help your child to learn the spelling list that is sent home each week. Practise spelling words whilst you are walking to school, travelling in the car, or in the queue at the supermarket!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Have your child write words with pencils or paint, with chalk on the garden path or on the computer! You could even play games such as 'hangman' using the spelling words. 
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Choose 4 or 5 words to focus on at a time, but remember to re-visit the words you have already learned
      
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Keep a dictionary in your home and help your child look up unfamiliar words. Encouraging your child to read; reading with them is also a great way to improve spelling!
    </h3>
    <h3>
      There are also some great free interactive websites online children can practise their spelling skills.
    </h3>

    <h3>
      Your child in Year 2 (which is still KS1) might fail on words like 'giraffe' or 'gem' or 'giant' or 'station'.
    </h3>
    <h4>
      Your child can be in Year 3,Year 4,Year 5 or Year 6 which means they are in the KS2 Stages
